```shell
# day1 & day2
yarn init
yarn add ethers@5
yarn add dotenv

# day3
yarn add --dev hardhat

# Something is very strange, I want to init a hardhat project just in the day3 folder.During the "yarn hardhat init" command, I choose the root path to day3, but always show that day3 is not a hardhat project, so I change the day3 folder to root path.
yarn hardhat init


```
